Foremost, we want to express our gratitude to our advisor Associate Professor Anders MÃ¸ller, who has provided invaluable feedback and guidance throughout our work with this thesis. Our gratitude goes towards our respective partners as well, for putting up with endless talk about the infinite stupidity possible within the language of PHP. Thanks also for being supportive in general and dragging us away from thesis work for a much needed break in the late evenings with the promise of a well-prepared meal. Thanks to the students and staff of the Programming Languages research group for providing a friendly environment and refreshing hallway talks. Lastly, we want to thank the family and friends, who worked their way through the heavy amounts of spelling mistakes, missing commas and weird phrasing bound to happen in a project at the scale of a thesis. Without all these supportive people around us, this thesis would never have happened.
