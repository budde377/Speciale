It is evident from the evaluation of the analysis developed in this thesis that several parts of the analysis can be improved and further developed. The evaluation consists of small and simple case studies adapted to the supported language P0. Even these small cases strain the resource usage and P0 lacks many commonly used features of PHP, e.g.\ objects, variable variables, etc. 

In this chapter, the limitations, possible improvements, and further development of the analysis are discussed, the main goal being to enable analysis of large PHP programs, e.g.\ as large as the programs of the corpus presented in chapter \ref{ch:study}. This is done by focusing on three obvious subjects: Supporting all features of the full PHP language, improvements in the precision of the analysis, and improving the performance of the analysis implementation, in section \ref{sec:future1}, \ref{sec:future2}, and \ref{sec:future3}, respectively.
