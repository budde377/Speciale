It evident, from the evaluation of the analysis developed in this thesis, that several parts of the analysis can be improved upon and further developed. The evaluation consists of small and simple case studies adapted to the supported language, P0. Even these small cases strain the resource usage and the P0 subset of PHP lack many commonly used features. In this chapter the limitations and possible improvements and further development of the analysis are discussed. The chapter is split into three sections. First discussing what is needed to extend the support from P0 to the full PHP language followed by interesting precision improvements. Precision improvements are interesting if they expand the way the analysis can produce feedback for the user, otherwise they are traded for unnecessary loss of performance. Performance, being the topic of the last section of this chapter, need improvements in order to be able to handle the size of real PHP applications at a reasonable resource usage.
