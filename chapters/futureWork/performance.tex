\section{Performance}
Performance concerns can be split into two parts, namely theoretical performance and practical performance. First-mentioned is the performance of the specified analysis whereas the latter is optimizations in the implementation while still conforming to the specification of the analysis.

\subsection{Analysis performance}
\todo{does this split even make sense? What can be improved in the analysis specification performance-wise?}

\subsection{Implementation performance}
No performance optimizations have been made on the implementation of the analysis since performance have not been the primary concern.

The analysis lattice is the primary data-structure used and thus a major factor in performance regarding to memory usage. To obtain context sensitivity the State-lattice is stored multiple times in the analysis lattice and because of this minimizing the size of the State-lattice results in multiple times the performance gain.

The two lattice-parts Temps and HeapTemps are used to pass information between control-flow nodes and are specified as partial maps from temporary variable names and temporary heap variable names respectively. Keeping only specified entries in the map and returning a set ``empty'' value for unspecified entries keeps the memory usage reasonable. The current implementation never removes entries from the map which will keep growing in size with programs of larger size. Due to the nature of how these maps are used each entry can be seen as having a provider and consumer control-flow node. The provider node sets the entry which is then later used by the consumer node. To keep the maps small in size even with large programs the consumer nodes can remove the entries they consume. Graph \ref{graph:exexpr1} shows a simple control-flow graph to demonstrate the effect of letting the consumer node remove consumed entries. In listing \ref{lst:exampleLattice} the first line shows the entries which would be set in the Temps lattice-element associated with the last node without any optimizations. The second line shows the set entries with the optimization.
