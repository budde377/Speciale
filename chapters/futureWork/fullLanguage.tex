\section{Supporting the full PHP language}
The static analysis developed in this thesis supports the subset of PHP, P0, as defined in chapter \ref{ch:analysis}.
Section \ref{sec:langsubset} defines the restricted syntax of the P0, disallowing most dynamic features of PHP, and section \ref{sec:abseval} defines how abstract operators are restricted compared
