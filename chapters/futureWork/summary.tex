\section{Summary}
In this chapter we have proposed different ways to continue the work done in this thesis. To be able to use the analysis developed in chapter \ref{ch:analysis} in any real context the full PHP language have to be supported and performance have to be improved to be able to analyse larger programs. For the former we have proposed ways to handle dynamic features, the remaining cross-type operations, objects, resources and library functions. For the latter we have proposed a method to keep the lattice-parts concerned with temporary variables small in size regardless of the size of the program. We have further more proposed possible precision improvements at the cost of soundness if hypotheses about the use of references and creations/removals of object properties can be confirmed.
