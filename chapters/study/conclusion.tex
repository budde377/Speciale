\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:studyConclusion}
The purpose of the dynamic analysis was to determine whether PHP array usage can be split into semantic categories and if arrays stay in one category during their lifetime. 

The results show that generally arrays keep the same type during their lifetime. Furthermore, the usage of specific array operations proved almost exclusive for lists. This information can be used to define unexpected behavior reported by the static analysis.

A significant amount of arrays turned out to be objects with list-keys by the initial definition. These objects indicate that the object type is not providing significant information in itself, and show the possibility that the definitions of maps and lists consume the object type, i.e. letting maps and lists allow values of different type.

Almost every framework in the corpus contains cyclic arrays however these are nearly exclusively uses of the superglobal \texttt{\$GLOBALS} which is a special case of array even without considering its cyclic structure. The hypothesis therefore mostly holds and a naive approach can be taken to handle cyclic arrays in the static analysis.
