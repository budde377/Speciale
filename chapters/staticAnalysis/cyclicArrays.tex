\section{Cyclic Arrays}
As described in chapter \ref{ch:study} the dynamic analysis detected cyclic arrays in most of the corpus. To account for this the analysis have to handle cyclic arrays in a sound manner. When determining containment of arrays a cyclic array is treated as the $\top$-element in the array lattice, containing all other arrays. Whether an array is cyclic is determined every time containment is evaluated. A cyclic array may later become acyclic as shown in listing \ref{lst:cyclicAcyclic}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Cyclic to Acyclic array},label={lst:cyclicAcyclic}]
    $a = [];
    $b = &$a[0];
    $b = $a; // $a[0] now contains a cyclic array
    $b = 1; // $a[0] is no longer a cyclic array
\end{lstlisting}

\todo{does this array become acyclic in the analysis?}
