\section{PHP Language subset}
\newcommand{\syn}[1]{\langle\mathit{#1}\rangle}
\label{sec:langsubset}
To simplify the static analysis a subset of the PHP language, P0, is used. The PHP language has no formal definition and thus the language used here can not be formally shown to be a subset of the complete PHP language. The full PHP language is defined by the reference Zend Interpreter.

To simplify the analysis and keep the focus on arrays; resource handles and objects have been completely removed from the language. Dynamic dispatch (variable function names), variable variables and dynamic loading of code (\texttt{require} and \texttt{include}) have also been omitted. It is assumed that any possible path in a function body results in a return statement and return statements are only allowed in a function body. There are no anonymous functions, a limited number of statements but the language does support all reference features, i.e. reference assigning entries in an array or variables. Reading from and writing to the \texttt{\$GLOBALS} array should get or change the value of the variables, respectively. Creating a new variable by adding an new entry to the array does however not initialize a new variable in the global scope.

The syntax can be expressed with grammar \ref{gramm:p0}. Here $e : \syn{expr}$ denotes an expression, $e : \syn{rexpr}$ a reference expression, and $e : \syn{vexpr}$ a variable expression.   Furthermore it being a subset of PHP, a program is only valid in P0  if it is also a valid PHP program. E.g. while the syntax allows negation of arrays, this action yields a fatal error in PHP and may be considered as an invalid program, hence also an invalid P0 program. 

Notice that returning an $\syn{rexpr}$ with a non-reference function might result in a fatal error, e.g. when returning the result of an array-append operation, but the same operation is valid in a reference-function.
