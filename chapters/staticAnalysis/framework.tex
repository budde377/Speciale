\section{The Monotone Framework}
%\todo{global arrays GET, POST and COOKIE are initialized as maps with map or string values. Depth 1 is implemented, but arbitrary depth could be implemented easily. SESSION is a top array since anything can be stored in it and will be automatically serialized/unserialized between requests. FILES is a map of maps, each inner map providing data about the corresponding uploaded file}

In order to perform a dataflow analysis on a P0 program, the monotone framework is used. By defining a control flow graph, $G = (V, E, s,t)$, a lattice, $L$, a set of transfer functions $F_N : L \rightarrow L$, a initial lattice $i : L$, the empty lattice $\epsilon : L$, and a predecessor function, $pred : N \rightarrow N^*$

The initial array has all variables set to $Value(Null(\top))$ and contain super globals.
