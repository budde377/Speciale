\section{The Monotone Framework}
\todo{global arrays GET, POST and COOKIE are initialized as maps with map or string values. Depth 1 is implemented, but arbitrary depth could be implemented easily. SESSION is a top array since anything can be stored in it and will be automatically serialized/unserialized between requests. FILES is a map of maps, each inner map providing data about the corresponding uploaded file}

\todo{describe the monotone framework and how the informal CFG + transfer functions apply}

\todo{Write about initial lattice (Super globals + hloc)}

\todo{All Variables should map to NULL initially}

\todo{How is the lattice compared properly with an infinite domain of variables set to NULL}
