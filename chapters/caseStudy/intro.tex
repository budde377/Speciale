Evaluating the analysis presented in chapter \ref{ch:analysis} is performed by analysing six small P0 programs. These programs have been found by manually inspecting the corpus of frameworks used in chapter \ref{ch:study}, looking for uncategorizable arrays and usage of list-o



To evaluate the effect of the analysis developed this chapter studies an amount of cases and how the analysis applies to those cases. Each case consists of a small PHP program inspired by code from a real PHP application accompanied by the result of running the analysis on the case program, how the analysis reached the results and how the results can be used.

\todo{Add some text on how the analysis ran. E.g. speed, memory, etc.}
