Evaluating the analysis presented in chapter \ref{ch:analysis} is performed by analysing six small P0 programs. The first program is a constructed example illustrating how the analysis handle the two introduced array types. The last five programs have been found by manually inspecting the corpus of frameworks used in chapter \ref{ch:study}, looking for uncategorizable arrays and misuse of list-operations, e.g. \texttt{array\_pop} on a map. Discovering these programs did prove more challenging than first anticipated, partially because many of the uncategorizable arrays proved to be multidimensional arrays, which can be misclassified, as discussed in section \ref{sec:limitations}. When found, the programs were minimized (i.e. unnecessary logic were removed), rewritten to P0, and necessary library functions implemented. Running the analysis was performed with a context bound by length two, $k=2$, which imposes no practical restriction on the analysis\todo{not true, 5.3 uses recursion}, since the maximum possible depth of function calls in the examples is two. Since implementation of a fast and resource efficient analysis isn't a goal of this thesis, execution statistics, such as running time and memory consumption, has been omitted.
