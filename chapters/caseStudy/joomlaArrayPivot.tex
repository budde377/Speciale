\section{Array Pivot}
The following example is found in an array helper class in the Joomla content management system. The code is adapted to fit in P0 as well as shortened to only display necessary code. The function accepts an array as input and return an array with the unique values of the input array as keys and the keys of the input array as values. The odd thing about this function is how unique and duplicate values from the input array are represented differently in the output array namely as either a string/integer value or an array of string/integer values. See listing \ref{lst:pivotExample} for an example. This mix of arrays and scalar values in the resulting array forces the user of the function to check the data type before using the values. Necessary data type checks strongly suggests a bad design and the analysis provides warnings about suspicious use of arrays as seen in figure \ref{fig:pivotScreenshot}. Both warnings are based on the fact that values of the array associated with ``result'' might be arrays or scalar values.

\todo{the warning is due to path insensitivity, and not directly caused by the actual problem, we have to describe that somehow and argue that capturing the problem indirectly is good enough}

\begin{program}
\begin{lstlisting}
function pivot($source)
{
    $result = [];
    $counter = [];

    for ($i = 0; $i < count($source); $i++)
    {
        $rKey = $source[$i];
        $rValue = $i;

        if (empty($counter[$rKey]))
        {
            $result[$rKey] = $rValue;
            $counter[$rKey] = 1;
        }
        else if ($counter[$rKey] == 1)
        {
            $result[$rKey] = [$result[$rKey],
                              $rValue];
            $counter[$rKey]++;
        }
        else
        {
            $result[$rKey][] = $rValue;
        }
    }
    return $result;
}

$simpleArr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,1,5,3,7,9,0,4,2,5,8,4,3,8,9];
$result = pivot($simpleArr);
\end{lstlisting}
