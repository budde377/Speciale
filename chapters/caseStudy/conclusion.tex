\section{Conclusion}
\todo{Theoretical results}

Since this thesis doesn't focus on efficiency wrt. memory consumption or run-time, no such information is associated with this case study. It should however be noted that execution was reasonable fast, performed in seconds rather than minutes, this in spite of the current analysis being performed after running the static analysis of the IDE. The observed memory consumption was rather high which possibly follows from the implemented caching strategy of the lattice elements.
