\section{Conclusion}

The implementation of the analysis successfully indicated errors when a program contained suspicious arrays and operations. 

It would be interesting to add a warnings when two paths meet, e.g. after an \texttt{if}-statement, which was indicated by the second and third case. 

The inaccuracy of the $\top$ array also became apparent, where updating an top array would update most of the heap. It could be considered to modify the Array lattice, by adding an element between the ArrayMap and ArrayList elements and the $\top$ element

\begin{figure}

Array = 
\begin{tikzpicture}[baseline= (a).base]
\node[scale=0.9] (a) at (0,0){
\begin{tikzcd}
& \top \ar[d]\\
& \mathcal{P}(\text{HeapLocation}) \ar[dr]\ar[dl]\\
ArrayList\ar[dr] & & ArrayMap\ar[dl]\\
& \text{emptyArray} \ar{d}\\
& \bot
\end{tikzcd}};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}

Since this thesis doesn't focus on efficiency wrt. memory consumption or run-time, no such information is associated with this case study. It should however be noted that execution was reasonable fast, performed in seconds rather than minutes, this in spite of the current analysis being performed after running the static analysis of the IDE. The observed memory consumption was rather high which possibly follows from the implemented caching strategy of the lattice elements.
