\section{Month names and numbers}
\label{sec:monthnamenumber}

Program \ref{lst:monthsNoError} first defines an array-list of month names, \texttt{\$monthNames}, and uses a loop to create a new array-map, \texttt{\$monthMap}, where the month names are keys and the corresponding month numbers are values, e.g.\ given \texttt{\$monthNames = ["January", ... , "December"]} after running the program the map becomes \texttt{\$monthMap=["January"=>1, ... , "December" => 12]}. The constructed array-map is then used to print a string containing month number of a given input, e.g.\ the input \texttt{"August"} yields the string \texttt{"August is month number 8"} and input \texttt{"Duck"} yields \texttt{"Duck is month number "}. The input is provided by the super-global \texttt{\$\_GET}, which contains the data of the query string (as defined in \citeB{rfc3986}), as field \texttt{"monthName"}. 


\begin{program}
\begin{lstlisting}
<?php

$monthNames = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"]; %* \label{line:mne-1} *)
$monthMap = []; %* \label{line:mne-2} *)

for($i = 1; $i <= 12; $i++) {
	$monthMap[array_pop($monthNames)] = $i; %* \label{line:mne-3} *)
}
$input = $_GET["monthName"];

echo $input . " is month number " . $monthMap[$input];
\end{lstlisting}

\end{program}

The array creation at line \ref{line:mne-1} is performed by initializing an empty array and immediately thereafter appending the month names. Since the only operations performed on the array are appends, the analysis will represent the array as a list of strings. At line \ref{line:mne-2}, the \texttt{\$monthMap} variable is initialized to an empty array. The analysis will represent this as emptyArray, since no operations are yet performed on the array. Notice how this explicit initialization is not necessary since any subsequent array operation will implicitly initialize the array. The month array-map is first modified at line \ref{line:mne-3} by an array-write operation with keys from the month-names array. Since the function \texttt{array\_pop} is used to generate the key, which may return \texttt{null} if the given array is empty, \texttt{\$monthMap} will be represented as an array-map with NotUIntString mapping to UInt. 

The analysis yields no error or warning, following from the arrays being treated properly, i.e.\ when first represented as either lists or maps only the \emph{right} operations are performed on them, e.g.\ writes with string keys on maps and \texttt{array\_pop} on list.
